### Postcodes

There are two files, [ONSPD](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets?q=ONS+Postcode+Directory+(ONSPD)+zip&sort_by=updated_at) and [NHSPD](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets?q=NHS+Postcode+Directory+(NHSPD)+full+zip&sort_by=updated_at), with mostly overlapping information.

Both contain ALL:
 - current (*live*) postcodes within the UK, as received monthly from the various postal admin within the UK
 - terminated (*closed*) postcodes that have NOT been subsequently re-used

We'll be using only the shorter 7-char *PCD* form: 
 - *outward* code as 2/3/4 chars, left aligned (3rd and 4th char may be blank)
 - *inward* code always 3 chars (1st numeric, 2nd and 3rd alpha), right aligned
